# SoulSteel-Injects
All my inject mods for the SoulSteel resource packs, as well as instructions on successfully injecting each one, can be found here.
If you want me to create an inject for you, let me know! I'll see if it complies with the rules, then if it does I'll happily make it and add it here.

You can find these, and some other mods, on ModSteel, which you can join [here](https://discord.gg/7zYdQ3W5eG).

If you want a private inject (that is, only for yourself), I have a limit of up to 3 changes for those (a change can be a single model, a bunch of text, or a single texture. if it's a model resize, that texture change doesn't count). Those will not be posted here.

## List of Injects:
### Smol Weapons Mod - v1.0
Makes every weapon smaller - will be updated when new weapons are released!
### Regulars to Riches
Makes Scholar's Robes, Demolition Duds, Ranger's Rags, Soldier's Armor and Explorer's Attire more stylish to bring them closer in vibe to the artifact armors.
