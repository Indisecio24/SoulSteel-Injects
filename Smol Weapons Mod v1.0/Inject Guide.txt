Smol Weapons Mod - v1.0
Injection Guide

Hello! Thanks for choosing to download this mod!
Things will be a bit technical, but follow this guide and you should be fine!

- Part 1: Locate the pack to inject into -

To start with, locate the cache files within your Minecraft Bedrock installation.
(There are plenty of people to ask about this.)

Locate the pack with UUID 25de309f-1f0b-4082-9b09-cfbe8d7f4b46, which has the name "SoulSteel - gear", hence referred to as simply "gear".

- Part 2: Models (the most important part) -

Once you're inside the pack, navigate the following folders:

models -> entity -> attachable

You should see four folders and a file - the ones that matter to us are the regular and ultimate folders.

Copy the contents of the mod's regular folder into the one from the pack, and do the same for the ultimate folders.
(The regular and ultimate folders inside the mod are in the mod's models folder)

- Part 3: Textures (so it looks right) -

Go back to before the models folder; now navigate the following folders:

textures -> entity -> n

Copy the contents of the mod's textures folder into the attachable folder here.
(NOT the vfx folder.)

- Part 4: See it in-game -

If you followed all the steps correctly, you should be able to load right in to SoulSteel and check out the mod!

Enjoy!
